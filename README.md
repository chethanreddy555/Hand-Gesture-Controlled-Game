# Hand Gesture Controlled Game

## Introduction
The Hand Gesture Controlled Game is a project that leverages Python and computer vision techniques to create an interactive gaming experience. Using a webcam, players can control the game's movement by performing hand gestures, such as closing their hands to accelerate or brake.


##Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the game, ensure you have the following installed:
Python (version 3.8 or higher)
Install requirement.txt

## Running the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
ex: cd hand-gesture-controlled-game

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
2.1 Open the hand_gesture_game.ipynb Notebook:
* Navigate to the directory where the notebook is located.
* Launch Jupyter Notebook using conda environment or run jupyter notebook command in the terminal.
* Click on the hand_gesture_game.ipynb file to open it in the Jupyter Notebook interface.

2.2 Execute Each Cell in the Notebook to Run the Game:
* Once the notebook is open, execute each cell sequentially by clicking on the cell and pressing Shift + Enter.
* Ensure that you have installed all the required libraries and dependencies before executing the cells.

2.3 Download the Game (Optional):
* If you wish to download the game for Windows, Mac, or PC, visit our website or find it on the Play Store (if available).
* Provide instructions or a link to the website or Play Store where users can download the game.
Note: 
* If we are using Linux then we should run game from online.

2.4 Run the Game in Parallel with the Notebook:
* It's important to note that the game should be run separately from the notebook.
* After running the cells in the notebook, the game will start, and your webcam feed will appear with instructions on how to control the game using hand gestures.
* Ensure that the notebook is running in one window while the game is running in another to enable parallel execution.


## Game Controls

1. Gas Control: Close your right hand to accelerate.
2. Brake Control: Close your left hand to brake.
3. Quit Game: Press the 'q' key to quit the game.
